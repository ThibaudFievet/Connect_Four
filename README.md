# Connect 4 (Puissance 4)

> **Context:** This repository contains the code from my very first steps into programming during my high school years (11th Grade / Première) in the NSI (numerique et sciences informatiques) specialization. **This project was realized as a duo effort.**

## Why this project is here

It was important for me to share this project exactly as it was.

I have deliberately chosen to keep this **original version** untouched to serve as a baseline. It shows where I started, using the logic and tools we understood at the time (basic loops, lists, and procedural programming).

## What's Next

My goal is to take this specific project and rebuild it from scratch using my current professional standards, including:
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** instead of procedural functions.
* **Clean Architecture** and robust error handling.
* **A Graphical User Interface (GUI)** or a web interface.

## About The Original Code

This script runs a standard game of Connect 4 in the terminal.
