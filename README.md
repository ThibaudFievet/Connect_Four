# 🔴 Connect 4 (Puissance 4) - The Origin Story

> **⚠️ Context:** This repository is a time capsule. It contains the code from my very first steps into programming during my high school years (11th Grade / Première) in the NSI (numerique et sciences informatiques) specialization.

## 💭 Why this project is here

It was important for me to share this project exactly as it was.

I have deliberately chosen to keep this **original version** untouched to serve as a baseline. It shows where I started, using the logic and tools I understood at the time (basic loops, lists, and procedural programming).

## 🔜 What's Next

My goal is to take this specific project and rebuild it from scratch using my current professional standards, including:
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** instead of procedural functions.
* **Clean Architecture** and robust error handling.
* **A Graphical User Interface (GUI)** or a web interface.

## 📝 About The Original Code

This script runs a standard game of Connect 4 in the terminal.

### How to Run (Original Version)
You need Python installed on your machine.
